Toy code written during 4 weeks of winter research in the Complex and Intelligent Systems (CIS) group at the
University of Queensland (http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/cis/home). The aim was mainly to learn 
how neural networks work, with a focus on spiking neural networks. There was also some effort to
build a neural network for working with event-based data from the DVS128. Some of the code for processing
the DVS data was written by other members of CIS.
